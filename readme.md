# To do / Ideas
This list is changing when I have new ideas or when I get feedback from friends and _Analyzer_ Team at [Slideworx](https://slideworx.com) - thanks guys!

1. Change mechanism for applying sorts.
2. Allow multiselection for dictionary (select) fields.
3. Text filtering should allow multi search with comma separated values.
4. Work with font size to allow more content in item list.
5. Allow collapsing of left and right panel.
6. Add option to expand stats panel.
6. Add simple charts to stats visible when stats are expanded.
7. Work out algorithm for adding color borders for items that will mark rank for chosen field. Need to somehow set min and max.
8. Add loading markers for fields, list and stats.
9. Inline above fold styles to speed up page load.
10. Move heavy operations to the web workers.
11. Cleanup hardcoded colors in styles.
12. Make better styles for sort markers and field inputs in general.
13. ~~Add links to metacritic.~~
14. Make the app mobile friendly.
15. Add the "watched/added" field.

17. Extract the generic part to the separate package.
18. Cleanup package dependencies.
